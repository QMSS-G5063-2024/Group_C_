## **Topic: The relationship between size of the house, #of bedrooms, #of bathrooms and its price.**

We began our analysis by using a heatmap to visualize the relationship between the property square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and its price. As indicated in the graph, all variables show a positive correlation relationship between any two variables. Among these, number of baths and number of beds have strongest correlation. Moreover, it becomes evident that properties with a greater number of bedrooms and bathrooms correspond to larger square footage and command higher prices.

```{r}
# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- ny_house_data %>%
  select(PROPERTYSQFT, BEDS, BATH, PRICE) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Melt the correlation matrix for plotting
melted_correlation_matrix <- reshape2::melt(correlation_matrix)

# Plot the heatmap with blue color scheme, improved appearance, centered title, and bold headline
ggplot(melted_correlation_matrix, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size = 0.2) +  # Add white borders to tiles
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#d9f0ff", high = "#4287f5", mid = "white", midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab", name = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")) +  # Center plot title and make it bold
  labs(x = "", y = "") +  # Remove axis labels
  ggtitle(bquote(bold("Correlation Heatmap")))  # Set the centered and bold title
```

## **Topic: What are the incremental average price contributions for each house type?**

When analyzing property values, understanding the incremental average price contributions for different house types is crucial. The waterfall chart above illustrates the incremental average price contributions for various house types. Each blue box represents a specific house type, and its size corresponds to the incremental contribution to the average price. From the graph, we can conclude that major house types like 'contingent', 'foreclosure', 'multi-family home for sale', and 'townhouse for sale' significantly contribute to the average price.

```{r}
# Calculate average price by house type and sort in increasing order
average_price_by_type <- ny_house_data %>%
  group_by(TYPE) %>%
  summarize(AveragePrice = mean(PRICE, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(AveragePrice)

# Calculate incremental changes in average price
average_price_by_type <- average_price_by_type %>%
  mutate(Incremental = AveragePrice - lag(AveragePrice, default = first(AveragePrice)))

# Create a waterfall chart using ggplot2 with wider bars
ggplot(average_price_by_type, aes(x = reorder(TYPE, AveragePrice), y = Incremental, fill = Incremental > 0)) +
  geom_rect(aes(x = TYPE, xmin = as.numeric(as.factor(TYPE)) - 0.4, xmax = as.numeric(as.factor(TYPE)) + 0.4, ymin = lag(cumsum(Incremental), default = 0), ymax = cumsum(Incremental)), 
            color = "black", fill = ifelse(average_price_by_type$Incremental > 0, "#4287f5", "#d9f0ff")) +
  labs(
    title = "Waterfall Chart of Average Price Contributions by House Type",
    x = "House Type",
    y = "Incremental Average Price"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4287f5", "#d9f0ff"), guide = "none") +  # Blue color scheme
  ggtitle("Waterfall Chart of Average Price Contributions by House Type")  # Centered and bold title
```

## **Topic: How do house prices vary by type? Which house type is most expensive/cheap?**

From the bar chart above, we can conclude that 'Townhouse for sale' has the highest selling price, while 'co-op for sale' has the lowest. Furthermore, 'Townhouse for sale' exhibits the widest price range, while 'Contingent', 'Foreclosure', and 'Co-op for sale' have comparatively narrower price ranges. Notably, 'Co-op for sale', 'Condo for sale', 'House for sale', and 'Multi-family for sale' display a higher number of outliers.

```{r}
# Create a boxplot of house prices by house type with a blue color palette
ggplot(ny_house_data, aes(x = TYPE, y = PRICE, fill = TYPE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "House Prices by House Type",
    x = "House Type",
    y = "Price"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5","#4287f5")) +  # All blue colors
  ggtitle("House Prices by House Type")  # Centered and bold title
```

## **Topic: Mapping of Residential Establishments Available**

This interactive leaflet map illustrates the geographic distribution of establishments available in all five boroughs of New York City. Individual establishments are first printed out in blue circles with pop-up window indicating the address, establishment type and the establishment's price per square foot. When zooming out, one could see the agglomerates with a number indicating how many establishments there are in certain area. This visualization helps identify the density of accommodation resources within New York City and adding the interactivity allow users to freely navigate amongst different neighborhoods.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
# Create the Leaflet map
p1 <- leaflet(ny_house_data_map) %>%
  addTiles() %>%    
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ny_house_data_map$LONGITUDE, lat = ~ny_house_data_map$LATITUDE,
             popup = ~paste("<b>Address:</b>", ny_house_data$FORMATTED_ADDRESS,"<br>",
                            "<b>Establishment Type:</b> ", ny_house_data$TYPE,"<br>",
                            "<b>Price per sqft:</b> ",PRICE_PER_SQFT=ny_house_data$PRICE_PER_SQFT),
               clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
p1
```

## Medium Price Per Sqft by Zip Codes

This interactive leaflet map is a choropleth map which is shaded with median price per square foot in each USPS zip codes blocks. The color scheme is from bright yellow to dark purple, which brighter color indicate higher median price per square foot. This visualization provides an overview of New York City's house market price level on a smaller spectrum--by neighborhood. The interactive feature allow users could zoom in and select specific neighborhoods to check the exact median price.

```{r}
library(sf)
library(viridis)

# Convert the character strings to spatial objects
zip_codes_with_prices <- st_as_sf(zip_codes_with_prices, wkt = "the_geom")

# Create a color palette based on the average prices
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "viridis", domain = zip_codes_with_prices$median_price)

# Create a leaflet map centered over a specific location 
p2 <- leaflet(data = zip_codes_with_prices) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(median_price),  # Color by median_price
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    color = "black",  # Border color
    weight = 1,  # Border thickness
    popup = ~paste("Zip Code:", MODZCTA, "<br>Median Price:", median_price),  # Add popup info
    highlight = TRUE  # Highlight on hover
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    pal = pal,
    values = zip_codes_with_prices$median_price,
    title = "Median Price Per Sqft",
    position = "bottomright"  # Legend position
  )

p2
```

```{r}
ny_retail_data <- read.csv("retail-food-stores 1.csv")

# Convert relevant columns to numeric
ny_retail_data$Zip.Code <- as.numeric(ny_retail_data$Zip.Code)

#Select a subset of data interested 
ny_retail_data <- ny_retail_data %>%
  select(
    Name = DBA.Name,
    EstablishmentType = Establishment.Type,
    City = City,
    ZipCode = Zip.Code,
    Location = Location
  )

#Mutate the data to etract Latitude and Longtitude
ny_retail_data <- ny_retail_data %>%
  mutate(
    Latitude = as.numeric(str_extract(Location, "(?<='latitude': ')[^']+")) ,
    Longitude = as.numeric(str_extract(Location, "(?<='longitude': ')[^']+")),
    Location = NULL
  )

# For simplicity, remove rows with missing values
ny_retail_data <- ny_retail_data %>% na.omit()
```

```{r}
ny_zip_codes <- zip_codes_with_prices %>%
  select(ZipCode=MODZCTA)

ny_retail_data <- ny_retail_data%>%
  filter(ZipCode %in% ny_zip_codes$ZipCode)
```

## Topic: Retail and Residential, Any Correlation?

We are also interested in examining if there's correlation between number of retail stores and the house price. This interactive leaflet map function similarly as the previous one, mapping out individual retail establishments and showing agglomerates once zoomed out.

```{r}
p3 <- leaflet(ny_retail_data) %>%
  addTiles() %>%    
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ny_retail_data$Longitude, lat = ~ny_retail_data$Latitude,
             popup = ~paste("<b>Name:</b>", ny_retail_data$Name,"<br>",
                            "<b>Establishment Type:</b> ", ny_retail_data$EstablishmentType,"<br>"),
               clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
p3
```

```{r}
establishments_by_zip <- ny_retail_data %>%
  group_by(ZipCode) %>%
  summarise(
    num_establishments = n_distinct(Name)
  )

zip_codes_with_num <- left_join(zip_codes_with_prices,establishments_by_zip,by=c("MODZCTA"="ZipCode"))

zip_codes_with_num <- zip_codes_with_num %>% na.omit()

```

## **The Number of Retail Establishment by Zip Codes**

This interactive leaflet map is a choropleth map which is shaded with the number of retail establishment in each USPS zip codes blocks. The color scheme is from bright yellow to dark purple, which brighter color indicate more retails. This visualization provides an overview of New York City's retail activity on a smaller spectrum--by neighborhood. The interactive feature allow users could zoom in and select specific neighborhoods to check the exact number of retailers.

```{r}
# Convert the character strings to spatial objects
zip_codes_with_num <- st_as_sf(zip_codes_with_num, wkt = "the_geom")

# Create a color palette based on the average prices
pal2 <- colorNumeric(palette = "viridis", domain = zip_codes_with_num$num_establishments)

# Create a leaflet map centered over a specific location 
p4 <- leaflet(data = zip_codes_with_num) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal2(num_establishments),  # Color by median_price
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    color = "black",  # Border color
    weight = 1,  # Border thickness
    popup = ~paste("Zip Code:", MODZCTA, "<br>Number of Retail Establishment:", num_establishments),  # Add popup info
    highlight = TRUE  # Highlight on hover
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    pal = pal2,
    values = zip_codes_with_num$num_establishments,
    title = "Number of Retail Establishment",
    position = "bottomright"  
  )

p4
```

```{r}
retail_food_stores <- read_csv("retail-food-stores_sub.csv")
```

```{r}
library(stringr)

# Extract zip code from 'Main_address' column in ny_house_data
ny_house_data <- ny_house_data %>%
  mutate(Main_address_zip = str_extract(MAIN_ADDRESS, "\\d{5}"))

# Convert 'Zip Code' column in retail_food_stores to character
retail_food_stores <- retail_food_stores %>%
  mutate(`Zip Code` = as.character(`Zip Code`))

# Join datasets using 'Zip Code' from retail_food_stores and 'Main_address_zip' from ny_house_data
combined_data <- inner_join(retail_food_stores, ny_house_data, by = c("Zip Code" = "Main_address_zip"))

# Aggregate the data by zip code, housing price, and use the number of rows as a proxy for the count of retail stores
aggregated_data <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(`Zip Code`, PRICE) %>%
  summarise(Retail_Store_Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```



To delve into the factors influencing divergent housing prices across neighborhoods, we explored whether the accessibility of retail stores, such as Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts or other stores, might impact housing values. We hypothesized that neighborhoods boasting greater retail convenience might command higher housing prices. To test this hypothesis, we used an additional dataset (retail store dataset), and focused on the New York City area as an example. For each neighborhood (zip code), we computed the average housing price alongside the number of retail stores present.

Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal a distinctly clear correlation between these variables. However, interestingly, certain zip code areas, like 10023 and 10024, exhibited a trend where fewer retail food stores coincided with lower neighborhood prices.


```{r}
# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = `Zip Code`, y = PRICE, color = Retail_Store_Count)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Neighborhood Housing Price vs. Retail Store Count",
    x = "Zip Code",
    y = "Neighborhood Housing Price",
    color = "Retail Store Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)
  )
```

# Calculate the first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), and IQR
Q1 <- quantile(ny_house_data$PRICE, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(ny_house_data$PRICE, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Filter out rows with `PRICE` values outside of the bounds
ny_house_data <- ny_house_data %>%
  filter(PRICE >= lower_bound & PRICE <= upper_bound)
```

## **Property Type Counts:**

This bar chart titled "Property Type Counts" showcases the frequency of different property types available for sale. At first glance, it's apparent that the most common type is the 'House for sale', towering over the others with the highest count. Following that, 'Condo for sale' and 'Multi-family home for sale' are also quite prevalent in the market. On the lower end of the spectrum, there are categories like 'Mobile home for sale' and 'Pending home for sale', which are less numerous.

We find it interesting to note the diversity of property types, indicating a vibrant and varied real estate market. This chart effectively communicates the breakdown of property types, providing a clear visual representation that can be easily interpreted at a glance. It's a useful tool for quickly assessing which types of properties dominate the market and could inform decisions for both real estate professionals and potential buyers.

```{r}
# Count the number of occurrences of each property type
property_counts <- ny_house_data %>%
  count(TYPE, sort = TRUE)  # Count and sort by the number of each type

# Create an interactive bar chart
interactive_bar_chart <- plot_ly(data = property_counts, x = ~TYPE, y = ~n, type = 'bar', marker = list(color = 'rgb(158,202,225)', line = list(color = 'rgb(8,48,107)', width = 1.5))) %>%
  layout(title = "Property Type Counts", xaxis = list(title = "Property Type"), yaxis = list(title = "Count"))

```

## **Topic: Impact of Broker Influence on Property Values Across Different Square Footages**

In this scatter plot, we've visualized the relationship between house prices and property square footage, as managed by different real estate brokers. Each point on the graph represents a property, with the horizontal axis showing its size in square feet and the vertical axis showing its price. The color of each point corresponds to a specific broker, allowing me to see at a glance how the property size relates to its price across various brokers.

From this graph, we can observe that certain brokers, like those represented by the clusters of points towards the bottom, have a range of properties at varying sizes and prices, while others may specialize more in either higher or lower-priced markets, regardless of the size. For instance, some brokers seem to handle more expansive properties, as indicated by the larger square footage values, while others have properties that are smaller but vary widely in price.

By making this plot interactive with plotly, we enable the viewer to hover over individual points to get more detailed information, such as the exact size, price, and the broker listing the property. This level of interactivity makes the plot a powerful tool for interactive data exploration and provides valuable insights into the real estate market's pricing strategies from a broker.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate median prices and rank brokers
broker_ranks <- ny_house_data %>%
  group_by(BROKERTITLE) %>%
  summarise(Median_Price = median(PRICE, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(Median_Price))

top_brokers <- head(broker_ranks, 10)$BROKERTITLE
bottom_brokers <- tail(broker_ranks, 10)$BROKERTITLE

# Filter data for top and bottom brokers
top_bottom_data <- ny_house_data %>%
  filter(BROKERTITLE %in% c(top_brokers, bottom_brokers))


library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Creating Scatter Plot
scatter_plot <- ggplot(top_bottom_data, aes(x = PROPERTYSQFT, y = PRICE, color = BROKERTITLE)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_color_manual(values = rep("blue", 20)) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of House Prices vs. Property Square Footage",
       x = "Property Square Footage (sq ft)",
       y = "House Price") +

ggplotly(scatter_plot)




```

## **Topic: House Price Range Distribution Across Top and Bottom Brokers**

Here we have a heatmap titled "House Price Distribution Heatmap by Broker," which I've created to analyze and visualize the property pricing strategies of different real estate brokers. This chart categorizes properties based on their price range, displayed on the y-axis, and the corresponding brokers on the x-axis.

Each cell's color intensity reflects the number of properties that fall within a specific price range for a given broker. Darker shades of blue indicate a higher concentration of properties within a price range, as denoted by the color scale on the right. For example, you can see that some brokers have a higher concentration of properties in particular price ranges, shown by the dark blue tiles.

This visual representation allows me to quickly identify patterns and outliers in the pricing strategies of these brokers. It's clear that some brokers tend to handle properties within a narrower price range, while others have listings spread across a broader spectrum of prices. This insight could be pivotal for potential buyers who are targeting specific price ranges, as well as for market analysts interested in the competitive positioning of brokers in the real estate market.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate median prices for each broker and identify top 10 and bottom 10
broker_medians <- ny_house_data %>%
  group_by(BROKERTITLE) %>%
  summarise(Median_Price = median(PRICE, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(Median_Price)

top10_brokers <- head(broker_medians, 10)
bottom10_brokers <- tail(broker_medians, 10)

# Combine top 10 and bottom 10 brokers
selected_brokers <- rbind(top10_brokers, bottom10_brokers)
selected_broker_titles <- selected_brokers$BROKERTITLE

# Filter the original dataset to only include these brokers
filtered_data <- ny_house_data %>%
  filter(BROKERTITLE %in% selected_broker_titles)



# Define price bins
filtered_data$Price_Bin <- cut(filtered_data$PRICE, breaks = seq(min(filtered_data$PRICE), max(filtered_data$PRICE), by = 50000), include.lowest = TRUE)

# Calculate the number of properties within each price range for each broker
price_distribution <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(BROKERTITLE, Price_Bin) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a heatmap
heatmap_plot <- ggplot(price_distribution, aes(x = BROKERTITLE, y = Price_Bin, fill = Count)) +
  geom_tile() +  # Fill with tiles
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue", name = "Count") +  # Blue gradient
  labs(title = "House Price Distribution Heatmap by Broker", x = "Broker", y = "Price Range") +
  theme_minimal() +
