# Abstract:
In our group project, we want to explore the New York Housing Market using a dataset that shows how real estate prices vary across New York City. We plan to use different types of charts and maps to make sense of this information.

We'll start with a map that shows average housing prices in each neighborhood. The map will use colors to show which areas are more expensive. Then, we'll look at how housing prices have changed over time with a simple line chart for different areas and types of homes. We also want to see what kinds of homes are most common, so we'll make a bar chart that shows the number of each type of property available. To understand what affects prices, we'll use a heatmap to show the relationship between a home's size, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and its price. Lastly, we'll create a waterfall chart to show how different factors contribute to the average price in different neighborhoods. 

Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to understand the New York housing market, whether you're looking to buy a home, sell one, or just interested in real estate trends.
